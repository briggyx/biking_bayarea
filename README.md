The API endpoint http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks can be broken down into several parts:

Protocol: The protocol used is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

Domain: The domain is api.citybik.es, which represents the web server that hosts the API. In this case, it's the Citybik.es API server.

Path: The path /v2/networks specifies the specific resource or endpoint on the server that the client is requesting. In this case, it's requesting information about networks from version 2 of the API.

Combining these parts together, the complete endpoint http://api.citybik.es/v2/networks represents a URL where a client can send an HTTP GET request to retrieve information about networks from the Citybik.es API version 2.

--------------------------
The provided API endpoint URL `https://api.citybik.es/v2/networks?fields=id,name,href` consists of the following components:

1. **Protocol**: `https://` specifies the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol, which ensures secure communication between the client and the server.

2. **Domain**: `api.citybik.es` represents the domain name of the API server. It is the address where the API server is hosted.

3. **Path**: `/v2/networks` is the endpoint path, which specifies the resource or data that the client wants to access. In this case, it is the networks resource from version 2 of the API.

4. **Query Parameters**: `?fields=id,name,href` is a set of query parameters separated by `?` from the endpoint path. Query parameters are used to modify the behavior of the API request or to filter the response data. In this case:
   - `fields=id,name,href` specifies that only the `id`, `name`, and `href` fields of the networks resource should be included in the response.

When the client sends a request to this API endpoint, it will receive a response containing network data with only the specified fields (`id`, `name`, and `href`).
